## Overview
 - This project is as a way to showcase my skills and recent works.
 - Animations are a big part of the website which is why I highly suggest checking the website itself as what the screenshots will show are extremely limited.

4. To install the dependencies, run `npm i` on the terminal
5. If you want to make changes on the SCSS files, either install `Live Sass Compiler Extension` on VS Code or run `sass --watch src/Styles/index.scss src/Styles/index.css` if you have dart sass installed on your local machine.

### Usage
- Customize the contents in each components to your liking.
- Styles folder contains all the styling-related files of the website. 
- `Components` contains thins such as font-faces, custom properties, and also the reset.
- `Pages` contains the styling for other components such as the `Header`, `Footer`, `Preloader`, etc.
- `index` is the main css file.
- Don't forget to update the links and buttons with your social media profiles.

## Process
 - Before I even make the design on figma, I was already looking for resources to use such as typeface, color palette, etc.
 - The initial Idea was to make the project a Single Page App but I decided to add other pages to add more context.
 - Once I felt like I can proceed with the designing process, I started working on the wireframes for the app, Initially It was just for the Homepage as I originally wanted it to just be a singe page app.
 - Once I was done with the wireframes, I proceeded with making the assets that I might use such as the Logo, Icons, etc.
 - After I was done with the assets, I started making the designs for the pages. It started with just the Homepage but I made several revisions along the way and added the designs for About, Works, and Contact Page.
- Once I was satisfied with the design, I then started developing the website based on the design with Mobile-First layout followed by the Desktop Layout and lastly are the Animations.
